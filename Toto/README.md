# Toto Checker

The Toto Checker Script is a Python program that allows users to check their Toto tickets against the latest winning numbers. It leverages the BeautifulSoup and requests libraries to scrape the Singapore Pools website and retrieve the most recent Toto results.

## Prerequisites

To run the Toto Checker Script, users must have Python 3 installed on their machine, as well as the BeautifulSoup, requests, and PrettyTable libraries.

## Installation

To install the required libraries, open a command prompt and run the following commands:

    pip install beautifulsoup4
    pip install requests
    pip install prettytable

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `toto_checker.py` script.
2. Create a text file called "numbers.txt" in the same directory as the script.
3. In the "numbers.txt" file, enter your Toto ticket numbers in the following format: "1,2,3,4,5,6".
4. Run the script: `python3 toto_checker.py`.
5. The script will output the winning Toto numbers and a table showing any winning tickets in the six prize categories.
